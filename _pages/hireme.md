## Hi! I’m Kwyn Meagher

I’m a full-stack engineer with a passion for API design and developer experience. I’m also a weekend warrior rock climber. I’m looking for my next thing! Maybe that’ll be with you.

### What

I’m looking for a senior full-stack role on a product or developer tools team.

#### Ideally you:

- Have non-men and non-white folks in leadership roles.
- Care about inclusivity as well as diversity in your organization
- Have great work/life balance, rarely work more than 40 hours a week
- Provide professional development opportunities
- Have an HR department
- Don’t have technical white boarding in your interview process
- Provide generous vacation, parental leave, and 401k matching
- Are not an agency or contractor
- Work in JavaScript, React, Go, Docker, and/or Kubernetes

### When

I’m available November 2018

### Where

Full time remote or in SF or Oakland

### About me

I’m a senior full-stack engineer with experience from designing css component systems to building and deploying docker containers. I’ve previously lead a team on HealthCare.gov and I’ve worked at both large and small companies on APIs and system integrations. I love writing functional code but realize when mutability is a necessary tradeoff. I believe software is inherently integrated with humans and that can’t be overlooked. I’m most happy when my work makes other peoples developers and/or consumers lives easier.

I have experience in Javascript, CSS, React, Redux, Flux, GraphQL, Node, Docker, and various other technologies

I’m just starting to ramp up on Go and I love it already.

If you think I’d be a good fit for your team, please email me at kwyn.meagher[at]gmail.com.
