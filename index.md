### Personal  

When I'm not tinkering with technology you'll likely find me on top of a rock some where, be it via hiking a trail or scaling the face of a cliff.

I have a passion for real food and Bio-hacking as well as the quantified self movement. I want people to be more connected with their food and more aware of the effects food has on the body. I believe there's a lot wrong with our current food systems and health care systems and I want to actively work to change this. If you have a company oriented in this regard please reach out to me.
