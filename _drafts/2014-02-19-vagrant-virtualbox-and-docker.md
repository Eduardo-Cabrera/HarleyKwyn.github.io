###Problem
It's difficult to use docker on a OSX system due to it's native linux development. 

##Solution
We can use vagrant and virtual box to interface with a linux environment with all the nice UI that we enjoy with the OSX environment

##Install Vagrant
This is pretty straight forward. First you'll need to install [VirutalBox] You can install [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) both use a gui-ed installer. So just follow the instructions after downloading each install .dmg. 

Once those are installed we can start the fun part. Spinning up a vagrant box.
