# 5 Days In the Whitney Zone
I'd spent the last three months training up to prepare for our trek into the Whitney Zone.
Mostly base training, lot of hiking up hill with a pack.
I'm glad I did as our trip to base camp would require only 5 miles of horizontal travel but 4300ft of gain to get to iceberg lake.
Based on our previous trip out to charlotte dome where our packs were pushing 45lbs for three days I knew we'd be caring at least that much. 
Our main objectives were The East Face of Mount Whitney and The Fish Hook Arete on Mount Russel.
A bare minimum of 22 pitches of climbing over the 5 days we were out there with some wiggle room for fatigue and weather.

I'm going to write this in a story format so if you just want the bare beta, you can skip down the [TL;DR section](#TL;DR)

# Acclimation Day at Tuolumne 1 
To kick off the acclimation process we decided to crag in Tuolumne.
We managed to only do one route as we couldn't find the other options as Spang had lost her guide book last year.
We climb the Direct North West Face of Lembert Dome which goes at 5.10c. 
Not exactly a warm up for me. 
I was a bit nervous but I knew I could pull on gear through the crux if I needed to.
The first pitch was rather uninteresting but the second pitches which involved either liebacking or technical finger crack footwork had me worked and a bit spooked.
The first crux I managed to pull after negotiating various stances in the awkward thin corner crack. 
The second balancy and technical straight in finger crack had me stumped on slippery granite. 
My typical toe jams didn't work as they had with Indian Creeks splitter wingate sandstone cracks.
The slick granite had me slipping and sliding right out and I couldn't make any upward progress. 
Eventually I gave up and yarded on some gear just to get to the top and save my skin and strength for the days to come. 
We were rewarded with a great view of the Tuolumne land scape and my stoke was rising for the days to come in the extreme high country of the Whitney Zone.

Granite has a distinct pleasure to it, something so re-assuring by it's weight, mesmerizing in it's various hews and glimmers. Something photos don't often catch is the the huge granite walls have a miriad of colors, greens, oranges, and golds. 
Often these colors come out in the names of climbs, such as the famous "moderate" route on The Incredible Hulk called "The Red Dihedral".
Named for the main feature of a long orange tinted dihedral running up the left side of The Incredible Hulk. 
A route I hope to some day tackle myself.
I don't think it's too far out of my reach.

After that we hung out by one of the many raging rivers in Tuolumne that had sprouted an offshoot stream that doesn't typically exist. 
We cooled our post climb kombucha in it and Spang played with her new survival toy, a Life Straw.
They're not as glamarous as one would imagine when you're trying to drink directly from a stream. 
We sat around and joked and thought about the potential for mountain running. 
Strap some sandals on a life straw to your arm and a Pro Bar or two and off you go.

After those shenanigans we attempted to run off and find the 9000ft bivy to sleep at a high elevation to optimize our acclimation. failed for not going far enough down.
We ended up camped out at Saddle Bag road which was closed off by a huge bulldozer.
We were pretty sure it was just to keep cars from driving up the road which has yet to be cleared of dibriues from the heavy winter storms.

## Hot Springs and Gear Packing
The next day we spent lazily in the back of Jake the Adventure truck then found our way to a lovely hot Springs in the Mammoth area.
We had one last soak surounded by buzzing dragon flies and bees.
Getting clean and relaxing staring at the mountains seemed such a strange contrast to what I knew was to come: an epic slog up 4300ft with heavy packs.
Once we were done soaking and relaxing we made the rest of the long drive down to lone pine to grab our permits and hurry up to the
## TL;DR
## Conditions
There's still a considerable snow pack and early in the morning the snow remains firm and having traction devices are necessary and approaches to both Whitney and Russel require an ice axe for self arrest. We only brought one ice axe and micro-spikes but found ourselves wishing for another axe and actual crampons.   

Steam crossings were tricky but not impassible. There are locations that are better than others, the crux is arguably the first passing of the North Fork river which required balancing on a log

Routes on Whitney and Russel are free of snow with the exception of the Mountaineer's Route
on Whitney. 

If you plan on sleeping in the whitney portal parking lot before you head out. 
I suggest sticking to the over flow parking lot as hikers tend to arrive late and have no consideration that people may be sleeping in their cars with intentions of alpine starts.
The lack of sleep from the constant flow of noisy hikers was a considerable sandbag for me in the morning when we trekked in.
