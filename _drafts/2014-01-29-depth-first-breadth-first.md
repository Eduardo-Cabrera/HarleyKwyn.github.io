So currently there are these nice articles on wikipedia to help you with [breadth first search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) and [depth first search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search).

I'm going to distill these out for you so you don't have to go through the pain of understanding the differences.

Their images of how the traversal works are actually spot on. So We'll put that here.
