They’ve given me multiple Hack Reactor T-shirts and one hoodie. I however am no longer officially affiliated with them, other than wearing my hoodie all the time.</p> <p>This is my FAQ, followed by a reflection.</p> <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2> <h3 id="how-much-does-it-cost-to-attend-hack-reactor">How much does it cost to attend Hack Reactor?</h3> <p>Tuition <strong>$17,780</strong> but this does not include the cost of <a href="#how-much-is-housing-in-sf?">housing</a> (It’s on their website but since you’ve come here I’ll humor you.)</p> <h3 id="how-did-you-pay-for-it">How did you pay for it?</h3> <p>I used Upstart, a selective on-line platform that connects investors to individual entrepreneurs, to fund the majority of my Hack Reactor tuition and living expenses (approximately $14k total that I had to come up with up front). I deferred part of the tuition and sold my beloved motorcycle to get the rest of the way.</p> <blockquote> <p>Deferral Program: Applicants who would otherwise be unable to attend Hack Reactor work with us on a case-by-case basis to split their tuition into installments that allow you to finish paying a portion of your tuition up to six months after your class has graduated. <cite> <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/program/#yui_3_17_2_1_1426632728607_265">Hack Reactor’s Website</a> <cite></cite></cite></p> </blockquote> <p>Hack Reactor now has <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com/blog/announcing-need-blind-admissions-for-hack-reactors-remote-beta-immersion-program">Need blind pricing</a> which is a much better deal than Upstart: Contrast five to 10 years of having to pay back 1 to 7% of your income per month (a plan no longer offered by Upstart), versus paying back Hack Reactor for a maximum of one year and only 1.4% of your income per month.</p> <h3 id="how-much-is-housing-in-san-francisco">How much is housing in San Francisco?</h3> <p>Inside of San Francisco the cost of housing is outrageous. Studio apartments frequently go for more than $3,000 per month, and housing is not included in Hack Reactor’s tuition. However, there’s no reason to live by yourself while at Hack Reactor–you’ll only be there for three months, after all!–and I encourage you to find a cheaper situation at a hostel or with a group of other students. I ended up paying about $1,000 per month at a hostel, which is decent but may be difficult to find. I suggest you look many months in advance and network with people in your cohort, and/or call in all family favors, learn to cook, forage, dumpster dive… Point is, do whatever you have to do to make it work–that kind of spirit will serve you well!</p> <p>I’d also suggest looking in the peninsula and East Bay. Anything along the <a href="http://www.bart.gov/schedules/bystation">BART</a> l line is doable. You’re going to spend most of your time at Hack Reactor, so there’s no need to have lavish living quarters.</p> <h3 id="is-the-99-number-real">Is the 99% number real?</h3> <p>It’s very real and <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-suspected-reasons-why-some-Hack-Reactor-graduates-the-2-are-unable-to-find-software-engineering-jobs-upon-graduation">this response on Quora</a> sums it up perfectly.</p> <p>TL;DR. Yes, 99% of people receive a job offer within three months of graduating. The average is also real and graduates often receive six-figure salaries at their first position after HR.</p> <h3 id="how-was-your-job-search">How was your job search?</h3> <p>TL;DR : It went swimmingly. I worked at one of the upcoming tech giants, then made a job transition to a better culture fit.</p> <p>The long version: It was stressful, but every job search is stressful. Hack Reactor does a great job of preparing you for interviews and negotiations. I received an offer within the first week after hiring day for more money than I could fathom back then; it was flattering and humbling all at the same time. I received three more offers over the course of my search and started working at Uber, as it was a rocket ship with plenty of room for growth. I ended up leaving, realizing I needed something more nurturing to a young queer trans* persyn. I then joined Technical Machine, a startup that builds a product called <a href="https://tessel.io">Tessel</a>. My position at Tessel is more aligned with my skills and interest in hardware, as well as my personal values.</p> <h3 id="how-did-you-prepare-for-hack-reactor">How did you prepare for Hack Reactor?</h3> <p>My personal journey prior to attending HR was much more gradual. I had enjoyed programming ever since taking the Intro to Programming courses at UC Merced. I even took C++ for fun my senior year because I wanted to know more. This is the kind of mentality you must have going into Hack Reactor to be wildly successful: One of curiosity, exploration, and the willingness to do something new and scary.</p> <p>As far as resources to point you to: In order to prepare for Hack Reactor interviews and coursework, I did <a href="http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges">Coderbyte challenges in JavaScript</a> up through the intermediate levels and some of the challenging ones and took <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript#jquery-basics">Code School</a> and <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">Code Academy</a> courses in <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript#jquery-basics">JavaScript and jQuery</a>.</p> <h3 id="reflection-was-it-worth-it">Reflection (Was it worth it)?</h3> <p>I wouldn’t give it up for anything. I’ve made so many friends I’m sure are going to be life-long, and the network of Hack Reactor students is ever growing. Hack Reactor gave me a rock-solid foundation in coding logic, then taught me how to learn and use most any tool within two days. It’s like having a superpower, almost, but nearly everyone has it if they can learn to unlock it.</p> <br> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=http://localhost:4000/Post-Hack-Reactor-Review/" class="btn btn_twitter" title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Twitter</span></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/Post-Hack-Reactor-Review/" class="btn btn_facebook" title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-facebook" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Facebook</span></a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://localhost:4000/Post-Hack-Reactor-Review/" class="btn btn_google-plus" title="Share on Google Plus"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-google-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Google+</span></a> &copy; 2017 <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KwynMeagher?rel=author"> Kwyn Alice Meagher </a>. <nav class="pagination"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/famous-2048/" class="pagination_pager" title="My Experience With Famo.us ">previous</a> <a href="http://localhost:4000/first-adventure-post/" class="pagination_pager" title="Charlotte Dome in a Day (…almost) Trip Report ">next</a> </nav> <div id="comments"></div> <script> window.onLoadCallback = function() { gapi.comments.render('comments', { href: window.location, width: '624', first_party_property: 'BLOGGER', view_type: 'FILTERED_POSTMOD' }); } </script> </div> </div> <!-- JS --> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> // Defines the configuration options, these must be set before you load // the platform.js file. window.___gcfg = { lang: 'en-US', parsetags: 'explicit' // DS?: can the onload param be removed from the line below and added here? // E.g., 'explicit','onload' } </script> <script src="https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js" async defer></script> <div class="overlay"> <ul class="projects-menu"> <li style="background:url(http://taylantatli.me/Halve/images/halve-home-image.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Halve" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Halve Jekyll Theme <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/754514/14509720/61c61058-01d6-11e6-93ab-0918515ecd56.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Moon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Moon Jekyll Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Ramme/master/assets/img/screenshot-post.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Ramme" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Ramme Jekyll Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Daisy-Pelican-Theme/master/Preview-1.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Daisy-Pelican-Theme/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Daisy Pelican Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Block-Icon-Theme/master/Preview.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Block-Icon-Theme" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Block Icon Theme <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/StartPage/master/preview.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/StartPage/" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Start Page <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </body> </html>
