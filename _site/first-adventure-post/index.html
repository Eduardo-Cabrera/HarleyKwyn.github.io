Eager to please, wanting to gain more experience climbing on real rock in the backcountry, and the bonus of spending time with the woman I was super stoked about, I said yes even though my cardio and climbing skills were dubious for this trip. If Spang says I can do it, I believe I can do it, and I could make up with strength for what I lacked in endurance.</p> <p>Charlotte Dome is a great classic climb, however it has a notoriously long approach. There’s too options for approaches to Charlotte Dome, one is from the East Side which requires a permit for Kearsarge Pass, the other is from the West Side which requires a permit for Bub’s Creek Trail. 7 mile sand 3500 feet of vertical gain to the base of the climb. Typically done in a 3 day stint hiking out the 6.5 miles and most of the gain, ~2000 feet. Which leaves 1 mile and 1500 feet of gain to get to the base of the climb. The climb itself is 10-12 pitches long and another ~1500feet of climbing. We had packed far too much food and water not knowing how much we could get away with though Bub’s “creek” was roaring.</p> <p>The week before the climb I ran around gathering both beta and info, tools and food. I printed out trail maps and route beta for both of us. I also planned the timing of the drive up and the food we would eat. We both weighed our gear cutting weight where we could since 7 miles in was no joke. I had recently gotten rid of my car so I didn’t have a vehicle to run errands with which lead to this epic photo:</p> <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="7" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div> <p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJrGtcoDR6Q/" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank">Getting ready for next weekend with a trip to REI and Berkeley Bowl.

My heart sank, I was worried we wouldn’t be able to do the trip I’d been looking forward to forward so long. Swallowing my internal panic I worked with her to lay out our options.</p> <ul> <li>Option 1. We do something else. Feeling the full weight of the sunk cost fallacy I was very much against this option.</li> <li>Option 2. We wake up early and attempt to be the first ones at the ranger station and hope that there’s some passes left. This seemed to be the better option though it was dicy</li> <li>Option 3. We leave super early and bandit camp near the base of the climb. I didn’t like this option because, in my mind, being caught was mortifying.</li> </ul> <p>We took option 2.</p> <p>So we stopped and bandit camped in the General Grant Tree National park <strong>(name check)</strong> Woke up early and arrived an hour before the ranger station opened. It didn’t matter. There were four parties ahead of us in line waiting for the ranger station to open. My anxiety levels rose as we waited for the ranger to arrive and as the clock ticked and hours of day light passed. Every minute we spent here was a minute we weren’t moving towards camp. I eaves dropped on every conversation ahead of us with the ranger listening if anyone asked for permits for Bub’s creek trail to figure out how many were left. Finally with only two people ahead of us someone asked about that trail and the ranger shook his head and was like, that’s been booked out for weeks and gave them other options. Spang and I conferred quietly before hand that we should just get a permit, any permit. If we were going to break the permit rules we at least better pay the park. We had never heard of any of our friends getting asked for permits before in the backcountry so we thought we had a good chance of sliding by in spite of the mountains of beta that warned us about the rangers in King’s Canyon. The ranger gave us an alternative itinerary that sounded awesome that would be a loop through the volcanic lakes and some cross-country bush whacking but it wasn’t climbing and would just be a slog with heavy packs through the back country.</p> <p>We didn’t prepare for a backpacking trip we brought minimal gear to cut enough weight to offset the climbing gear. Parking the car and loading up the gear we talked and decided on what we were going to do. I had my heart set on this climb, so I insisted we at least give it a try. What was the worst that could happen? We get fined and sent back to the trail head with our tails between our legs. Best case we get to climb Charlotte Dome as planned.</p> <p>My nerves vibrated with anxiety as we skirted the ranger station and headed up the trail. What if we get caught? I hate getting in trouble, I avoided it like the plague when I was little kid. A teachers pet from day one, this rule breaking felt unlike me. Our packs were brutally heavy and my cardio was miserably. We stopped at the river for a snack before heading up the switch backs that we were dreading.</p> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Kings_Canyon_Backpacks.jpg" alt="River Backpack Kings Canyon" /></p> <p>I eyed my watch constantly that was hooked up to my heart rate monitor. On the flats I could keep my heart rate at 120bpm but, as we started up the infamous switch backs on Bub’s creek trail, I couldn’t move at a decent pace without my heart rate spiking to 150+. Years of olympic lifting has conditioned my muscle to lift this type of weight anaerobically. I was getting sweaty and and exhausted fast. The only solace with the brilliant views of King’s Canyon from mid way up the switch back.</p> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Kings_Canyon_Valley.jpg" alt="Kings Canyon, The Valley Without People" /></p> <p>Eyeing ridges and spires that I dreamed I might be able to climb one day, wondering if anyone had ever climbed them.</p> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Sharktooth_Ridge.jpg" alt="Sharktooth Ridge" /></p> <p>Enjoying the views I was happy and relaxed for a brief moment until I saw a individual in khakis and a collard green shirt and a badge in the shape of a shield on his left shoulder. I knew immediately it was a ranger. We were caught. He asked for our permit and my heart raced as Spang pulled out the Permit that was for Mariposa Lake He looked it over and then looked at us how I imagine a parent looks at kid who’s just been caught with their hand in the cookie jar. I wouldn’t be surprised if I was blushing either. “Well,” he sighed after he lectured us about why there’s a permit system “I’d like to see you heading back toward the trail head. You have an awesome itinerary here and I think you would still have a good time on it. You should do it.” We thanked him and put on our heavy packs and trudged back down to the trail head, our feet dragging and our heads hanging a bit lower. I sat at the trail head honestly trying not to cry, I was so disappointed and exhausted. Spang rubbed my shoulders and we discussed what we might do. It was around noon at this point and starting on the other route seemed like a bad idea. Dead sure that that was our only real option, I was crushed. Then Spang through out something that hadn’t even crossed my mind.</p> <p>We could attempt to do it in a day.</p> <h2 id="plan-charlotte-dome-in-a-day">Plan: Charlotte Dome in a Day</h2> <p>It took me a while, mulling over the vert gain in my head and thinking about how long it took us to go as far as we did. Spang assuaged some of my fears by noting that our packs would be nearly 1/4 of the weight and we knew there was water so we could cary even less. 7 miles in with 3500 feet of gain, we estimated the following break down</p> <p>Time breakdown:</p> <ul> <li>5-6 hours to get to the base of the climb, and we could do it in the dark since there’s a trail most of the way there.</li> <li>6 hours to climb</li> <li>6 hours to descend and walk out</li> <li>2 Hours for any unforeseen events</li> </ul> <p>We’d start 0200 HRS, get the cut off by sunrise around 0700 HRS perfect for scrambling up an unknown talus field to the base of the climb at 0800 HRS. Climb and summit around 2pm, we estimated about a 30 minutes per pitch, most of it would be me following.And another 5 hours out, arriving at the car around 1000 HRS. We decided to bring a few extra things to make bivying a bit more comfortable considering that the likelihood of needing to bivy was high.</p> <p>Gear:</p> <ul> <li>1 single rack with a handful of tricams</li> <li>2 Harness</li> <li>2 Helmets</li> <li>2 sets of climbing shoes</li> <li>1/2 a chocolate bar</li> <li>6 Lara bars</li> <li>1 cliff shot</li> <li>1 70 meter rope</li> <li>Climbing tape</li> <li>First aid kit with water purification tablets</li> <li>2 Liters of water</li> <li>Warm silk sleeping bag liner</li> <li>Emergency Blanket</li> <li>2 pairs of socks (Spang and I use luna sandals as approach shoes)</li> <li>2 puffy coats</li> <li>2 patagonia hoodini jackets (ultralight wind breakers)</li> <li>2 R1 fleeces</li> <li>2 headlamps with spare batteries</li> </ul> <p>We spent the day wandering around the outskirts of King’s Canyon. Keeping our eyes peeled for a pullout that might be good to camp at as close to the national park boundary as possible since it’s illegal to camp in the park without a permit. After deciding on the plan the day turned around for me, I was excited at the thought of doing this epic thing. A climb that often took people three days in one really long day. This would be the beginning of my alpine obsession. We had lunch swam in the river and read “On The Nose” by Hans Florine, dreaming of days when I might be able to simul climb and short fix. While I have no desire to climb the nose I was quite enamored with Spang’s dreams of climbing it one day. We went to bed as soon as the sun went down around 7:30PM getting as much sleep as possible for the long day ahead of us.</p> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Reading_On_The_Nose.jpg" alt="Reading On The Nose by Hans Florine" /></p> <p>We woke up at 2AM, hopped in the car and drove to the trail head. Dawning our headlamps and gear in the dark parking lot hoping that our car wouldn’t be ticketed, we head out at a brisk pace on the flat before the switch backs. The approach was very serene with the exception of the roaring Bub’s “Creek” which to me really seemed more like a river. The sound was quite disconcerting in the dark when you couldn’t see it and when you flashed our headlamp towards it and saw the water rushing by your small view port it was quite horrifying. We kept our eyes on the trail after that. We arrived at the way point I had dropped for the cut off from the trail and ate our breakfast snacks.</p> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Dawn_Snacks_Charlotte_Dome.jpg" alt="Dawn Snacks" /></p> <p>Scrambling up the approach searching for cairns we ended up veering too far right (east) and found ourselves on some pretty serious terrain. There was a notch at one point that was low fifth class but with a rope in a pack it was difficult for me to get up, it was only my 4 month climbing, there were a few good hand jams and a chock stone as a foot hold that I was afraid of letting loose by stepping on it. Spang offered rope up for it but I wanted to give it a shot. I made the hand jam and started to step up on the chock stone when it fell out and went flying down hill. Dangling by my hand jam I was grateful for my strength and for the fact that no one was below us. I reset my feet and barely mantled my way up on top the ledge and we made the rest of the way back up to the base of the climb where we found our first problem of the day.</p> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Charlotte_Dome_Approach.jpg" alt="Approach Shot" /> <img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Approach_View_Charlotte_Dome.jpg" alt="Approach Shot 2" /></p> <h2 id="second-mistake">Second Mistake:</h2> <p>It was a holiday weekend, Memorial Day weekend to be precise. Climbers were numerous.</p> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Charlotte_Dome_Start.jpg" alt="Charlotte Dome Start" /></p> <p>There were at least 8 people ahead of us two of which were painfully slow. We had planned on maybe one group ahead of us that we might be able to pass. Spang attempted to negotiate some slab to the right of the “official” start but it was slow going for me and we couldn’t pass the group in front of us.</p> <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="7" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"> <div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"> <div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div> <p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BKHwPhLD-pG/" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank">Charlotte Domeaneering</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by christine spang (@spangster) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2016-09-09T04:06:25+00:00">Sep 8, 2016 at 9:06pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async="" defer="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script> <p>Either way it didn’t matter, the team at the start of them was slowest of them all and we ended up sharing belay stations frequently. Thankfully the belay stations were cushy ledges that were perfect for naps</p> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Ledge_Nap_1.jpg" alt="Ledge Nap 1" /></p> <p>We cruzed up the rest of the climb whenever the route was finally clear. The awkward corner and the slot were definitely the cruxes. In the awkward corner there were so many holds I was glad I had my helmet as some holds made a swing for my face. The slot is mostly awkward as it’s a pretty vertical wide crack. Climbing it today would probably not be as bad as I know how to stand on smaller features as well as climb off-widths but at the time it was definitely an challenge. Everything else was purely just enjoyable with holds abound. I can’t speak to the gear as I wasn’t leading.</p> <p>We eventually summited around sunset. Which made for spectacular views but I was worried about trying to get off at night and found myself in a rush.</p> <p>– Summit Photos –</p> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Spang_Summit_Sunset.jpg" alt="Spang Summit Sunset" /> Spang soaking in the sunset.</p> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Summit_Sunset.jpg" alt="Summit Sunset" /> Spectacular view, but it was unsettling to be summiting so late.</p> <h2 id="third-mistake">Third mistake:</h2> <p>There were the two obvious options to descend in the fading light: <br /> One: bivy at the top, which wasn’t a terrible plan since while we passed the summit block we found a awesome wind protected spot on soft dirt that would be a great candidate for over night bivy with our gear.<br /> Two: try to find the walk-off which stars as a 4th class down climb</p> <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Summit_Block.jpg" alt="Summit Block" /></p> <p>Because of this anxiety and panic we didn’t clearly think about the option to get off the top of Charlotte Dome. As we rounded the summit block we found a rappel station that some one made which went down the side of the dome instead of off the back which is where I believe the walk off decent starts. We had no idea if there were more rappel stations or where they would be. We looked trying to see where it would take us and it didn’t look the like the terrain was too terrible.</p> <p>We decided rappel.</p> <h2 id="death-slab-saga">Death Slab Saga</h2> <p>But the key thing was, we did not know where this rappel went or how far we needed to go. NEVER rappel if you don’t know that there’s another rappel station and the beta has told you that there’s a walk off. We only had a 70 meter rope. So each rappel could only take us 35 meters at a time. Which is not a lot considering how tall charlotte dome is.</p> <p>The first rappel was easy, there were rap rings and everything. and we landed on a cushy ledge into some trees. Then we had no where to go. We traversed left and right hoping to find something that we might rappel off.</p> <p>We eventually came across a fixed line tied off on a robust looking tree. However the fixed line itself looked core shot but it was our best option. We tied into the fixed line with a sling into our harness loops and used two locking carabiners to descend the rope so we always had one locked carabiner on the fixed line at all times. The fixed line eventually ended and we found ourselves in the middle of a endless slab.</p> <p>We traversed around to another flake and climbed down until the slab seemed unmanageable. We popped a couple nuts into the bottom of the flake and deformed them to an unusable state to make a minimal anchor. We didn’t want them coming out.</p> <p>$100 dollars, definitely worth our lives</p> <p>We popped in a couple cams and under a flake since it was too large for nuts to make another anchor anchor and rappelled.</p> <p>$200 dollars, still well worth our lives.</p> <p>Once again just short of safe. We then couldn’t go far enough to get to the flat part that was just in sight. Traversing left we eventually found a tree tree that already had a rappel anchor on it. Clearly we weren’t the first people to make this mistake. I believe left by the party that went ahead of us. It was our last rappel then we managed to walk over to the tree line that provided better terrain.</p> <p>We eventually found a cairn marking the walk off and our spirits lifted a bit. We started picking our way across trying to find cairns in the dark. At one point I actually lost our water bladder as my pack kept opening. Meaning we had no water or even a container for water. The terrain was near impossible to read and we actually passed the original cairn marking the base of the climb but we were too tired to recognize that. We lost the trail and ended up going down a gully and my energy was waining. My gut told me that the gully was the wrong way. After expressing that feeling Spang eventually called it and we bivyed under a tree on a bed of pine cones and the rope, our pack as a pillow. We had a relatively comfortable sleep as we cuddled and kept warm in the sleeping bag liner with the emergency blanket over us. The blanket fit Spang perfectly but was a little small for me and my hand was in the cold a bit so I slept fitfully but was warm enough to not get sick.</p> <h2 id="the-next-morning">The Next Morning</h2> <p>The sun eventually dawned and at first light we packed up and with some rest I was thinking more clearly and wanted to go back up to the last cairn now that there was light. This is when we realized that the large cairn was the cairn for the base of the climb. With two Lara bars left and half a sandwich and no water we started to pick our way back down. Some how we eventually found the walk off trail after sliding down some gravel shoots that was simultaneously fun and terrifying. I was getting dehydrate so we took the plastic bags that our sandwiches were in and filled them with water from the river so I could drink as much as I could. Spang had to go fetch water for me as I was too tired to do the 5th class down climb to the river just adjacent from the descent trail. The bag had holes in it but we managed to plug them with our hands. With water and food I was ready to make the trek back out and was in much better spirits knowing that we would be making it out soon.</p> <p>The long flat trail after the switch backs seemed to never end but I was immensely happy once we got back to the car, loaded up our gear and had a moment to sit and chug water.</p> <h2 id="the-drive-back">The Drive Back</h2> <p>On the way home Spang read more of “On the Nose” to keep me awake as I drove. We even stopped at my favorite taco place in Merced, <a href="">J&amp;Rs</a>, a throw back to my college days. As we ate dinner Spang and I recapped on the day on what worked well and what didn’t. The mistakes listed above were the obvious ones. Though I have left out the things that worked well.</p> <ul> <li>Doing Charlotte Dome in a long day is definitely do-able and I would consider it much preferred to the lugging all the gear out there for three days.</li> <li>Going light with food and water and knowing the water situation made the trip much more comfortable.</li> <li>Bringing cushier bivy gear knowing that the likely hood of bivying was high paid dividends.</li> </ul> <p>So it’s definitely an enjoyable day in the backcountry and can be done in without a permit even. So remember</p> <ul> <li>Stick to your plan</li> <li>Do the walk off</li> <li>Travel light</li> <li>Wake up early</li> <li>Don’t go on a holiday!</li> </ul> <p>Get out and crush it. 👊</p> <br> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=http://localhost:4000/first-adventure-post/" class="btn btn_twitter" title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Twitter</span></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/first-adventure-post/" class="btn btn_facebook" title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-facebook" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Facebook</span></a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://localhost:4000/first-adventure-post/" class="btn btn_google-plus" title="Share on Google Plus"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-google-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Google+</span></a> &copy; 2017 <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KwynMeagher?rel=author"> Kwyn Alice Meagher </a>. <nav class="pagination"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/Post-Hack-Reactor-Review/" class="pagination_pager" title="Post Hack Reactor Review, Nearly One Year Later ">previous</a> <a href="#" class="pagination_pager disabled">next</a> </nav> <div id="comments"></div> <script> window.onLoadCallback = function() { gapi.comments.render('comments', { href: window.location, width: '624', first_party_property: 'BLOGGER', view_type: 'FILTERED_POSTMOD' }); } </script> </div> </div> <!-- JS --> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <script> // Defines the configuration options, these must be set before you load // the platform.js file. window.___gcfg = { lang: 'en-US', parsetags: 'explicit' // DS?: can the onload param be removed from the line below and added here? // E.g., 'explicit','onload' } </script> <script src="https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js" async defer></script> <div class="overlay"> <ul class="projects-menu"> <li style="background:url(http://taylantatli.me/Halve/images/halve-home-image.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Halve" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Halve Jekyll Theme <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/754514/14509720/61c61058-01d6-11e6-93ab-0918515ecd56.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Moon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Moon Jekyll Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Ramme/master/assets/img/screenshot-post.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Ramme" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Ramme Jekyll Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Daisy-Pelican-Theme/master/Preview-1.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Daisy-Pelican-Theme/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Daisy Pelican Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Block-Icon-Theme/master/Preview.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Block-Icon-Theme" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Block Icon Theme <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/StartPage/master/preview.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/StartPage/" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Start Page <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </body> </html>
