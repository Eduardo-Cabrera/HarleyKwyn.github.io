I love pair programming. It has amazing advantages and I feel I learn a lot about coding when I'm working with another developer whether they be more or less advanced than myself. However, often I feel like an impostor. Am I coding or is my pair doing all the coding? This is the question I find myself asking often.

The way to deal with this is to make sure that whoever is typing, is following the verbal logic that the other pair is dictating. Never should one person be typing out code silently without input of the other pair. If you find your self sitting in silence and your pair is typing away without a word you should stop your pair and ask to drive for a moment and do the typing while they explain their logic to you.

Even when this balance between "driving" and "navigating" is achieved there's a key question that I ask myself.

Can I complete this prompt on my own, from scratch. If the answer in my head is yes, I attempt to go do it on my own and if I fail then I seek out help. This is not ideal though if you can't implement the same code that you just wrote with your pair by yourself, ideally you will follow the driving and navigating paradigm as best as possible..

This paradigm allows for a few things to happen. The driver acts as an interpreter for the navigator. If the navigator's logic is not sound the driver acts as a check against any faults in the logic. It also, in turn, allows the driver to experience the implementation of logic that may not be entirely aligned with their own.

So if you find yourself not driving, and instead navigating and coming up with logic, you should not feel like an impostor. You are the one coming up with the logic that makes the code work in the desired fashion and if you are driving, then you are also demonstrating the skills to interpret sound logic into code.

Just remember, the majority of coders throughout their life will feel like they are in impostor. You're not alone. Keep calm and code on.
