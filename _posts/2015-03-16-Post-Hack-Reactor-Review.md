This post was spurred by the many e-mails I receive asking about my experience at Hack Reactor from both strangers and friends. Often times members of my coed engineering fraternity from college.

Disclaimer: I worked as a HIR (Hacker in Residence) for Hack Reactor for three months post my graduation date. They've given me multiple Hack Reactor T-shirts and one hoodie. I however am no longer affiliated with them. Other than wearing my hoodie all the time.

This is my FAQ. Followed by a reflection.

##FAQ
###How much does it cost to attend Hack Reactor?
Tuition **$17,780** but this does not include the cost of [housing](#how-much-is-housing-in-sf?)
(It's on their website but since you've come here I'll humor you.)

###How did you pay for it?
I ended up using Upstart to fund the majority of my Hack Reactor tuition and living expenses ~14k and I deferred part of the tuition and sold my motorcycle to get the rest of the way which I dearly miss, but I'll be able to get a new one soon if I choose, but I prefer to bike to work now as it's much better for me and the environment. Hack Reactor now has [Need blind pricing](http://www.hackreactor.com/blog/announcing-need-blind-admissions-for-hack-reactors-remote-beta-immersion-program) which is a much better deal than Upstart. Contrasting 5-10 years of having to pay back 1-7% of your income per month (which is a plan no longer offered by Upstart) vs only paying back Hack Reactor for a maximum of one year and only 1.4% of your income per month.

>Deferral Program: Applicants who would otherwise be unable to attend Hack Reactor work with us on a case-by-case basis to split their tuition into installments that allow you to finish paying a portion of your tuition up to six months after your class has graduated. <cite> [Hack Reactor's Website](http://www.hackreactor.com/program/#yui_3_17_2_1_1426632728607_265) <cite>


###How much is housing in San Francisco?

Inside of San Francisco housing is outrageous. Studio apartments frequently go for $3000+/month. This is not included in Hack Reactors tuition. However, while at Hack Reactor, theres no reason to live by yourself and I encourage you to find a cheap situation at a hostile or with a group of other students. I ended up paying ~$1000/month which is decent but may be difficult to find. I suggest you look many months in advanced and network with people in your cohort.

I'd also suggest looking in the peninsula and east bay. Anything along the [BART](http://www.bart.gov/schedules/bystation) line that is communal living is doable. You're going to spend most of your time at Hack Reactor so no need to have lavish living quarters.

###Is the 99% number real?
It's very real and [this response on Quora](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-suspected-reasons-why-some-Hack-Reactor-graduates-the-2-are-unable-to-find-software-engineering-jobs-upon-graduation) sums it up perfectly.

###How was your job search?
TL;DR : Swimmingly. I worked one of the upcoming tech giants and made a job transition to a better culture fit.

The long version is it was stressful, but every job search is stressful. However, Hack Reactor does a great job of preparing you for the job search. I received an offer within the first week after hiring day for more money than I could fathom at the time. It was flattering and humbling all at the same time. I received three more over the course of my search and ended up going with Uber as it was a company on the upswing and was still offering equity and had plenty of room for growth. I ended up leaving disillusioned to how nurturing to a young queer trans*persyn and joining Technical Machine which builds [Tessel](https://tessel.io) which is more aligned with my skills and interest in hardware.

###How did you prepare for Hack Reactor?
My personally journey was much more gradual. I had a knack for programming ever since taking the intro to programming courses at UC Merced. I even took C++ for fun my senior year because I wanted to know more. This is the kind of mentality you must have going into Hack Reactor to be wildly successful. One of curiosity and exploration, the willing to do something new and scary in spite of and because it is just that, new, and scary.

As far as resources to point you to. I did [Coderbyte challenges in JavaScript](http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges) up through the intermediate levels and some of the challenging ones and took [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript#jquery-basics) and [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) courses in [JavaScript and jQuery](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript#jquery-basics).

###Reflection (Was it worth it)?
I wouldn't give it up for anything. I've made so many friends I'm sure are going to be life long and the network of Hack Reactor students is ever growing. Hack Reactor taught me how to learn and *use* most any tool within two days. It's like having a super power almost, but nearly everyone has it built into them if they can learn to unlock it.
