<p>Github pages are awesome, and with jekyll and cool themes like the one I’m using right now. You can make a rather nice polished blog in no time. Problem is… that ugly URL up there._githubHandle_.github.io. Wait this is my page! Not github’s</p>

<p>how can we fix that?</p>

<ol>
<li>Acquire a domain name I used <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy.com</a> but there are many <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">other sites</a> I’ve heard of some people using NameCheap which may be a better deal now than GoDaddy</li>

<li>Configure DNS at GoDaddy.com
<ol>
<li>When at GoDaddy navigate to the DNS Zone File of the domain page you want to point to your github.io page.</li>

<li>Click Edit and add two “A (host)”” to point to 192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.154 like the following image <img src="/images/GoDaddyZoneFile1.png" alt="GoDaddyZoneFile1" /></li>

<li>set the www alias to point to your <em>githubHandle</em>.github.io like the following image <img src="/images/GoDaddyZoneFile2.png" alt="GoDaddyZoneFile2" /></li>
</ol>
</li>
