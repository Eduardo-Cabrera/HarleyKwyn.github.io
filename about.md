##Personal

I have a passion for real food and Bio-hacking as well as the quantified self movement. I believe people need to become more connected with their food and more aware of the effects food has on the body.

As far as hobbies go, I love Olympic lifting and CrossFit however, I'm also working on hacking strength development with HIIT and Body by Science principles. Sadly all of this currently on hold until I finish Hack Reactor.

I beleive there's a lot wrong with our current food systems and health care systems and I want to actively work to change this. If you have a company oriented in this regard please reach out to me.
