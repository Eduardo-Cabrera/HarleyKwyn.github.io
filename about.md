Junior of the January 2014 [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/) Cohort
Succesfully funded [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/upstarts/kwyn-alice-meagher)

I have a passion for real food and Bio-hacking as well as the quantified self movement. I beleive people need to become more connected with their food and more aware of the effects food has on the body.

As far as hobbies go, I love olympic lifting and CrossFit however, I'm also working on hacking strength development with HIIT and Body by Science principles. Sadly all of this currently on hold until I finish Hack Reactor.
